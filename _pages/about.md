I am a first-year PhD student in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/). Before that, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2023. I am generally interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Currently, I am working on model evaluation.
